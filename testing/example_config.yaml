# Two main keys specify configuration

# options is a hash where each key is a global option keyword argument name.
# The type of each argument is the same as expected when using the API with
# kwargs except 'conf' which makes no sense to provide from a configuration

# groups is a list of task groups. Each element is a hash with the same kwargs
# that can be passed to the API. If the string keyword is present, it should
# be the same form as would be passed to the CLI (without separating ':') and
# all other kwargs are ignored. 
# Only 'string' or 'pes' and 'exe' are required: all other keys are optional.
